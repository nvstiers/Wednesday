    <h1>hey its wednesday</h1>
    <h2>aka hump day</h2>
    <p>(Lorraine and her friend Babs leave Ruth's clothes shop. They have a box and are laughing happily. Lorraine opens the box and pulls out the dress she will wear to the dance that night. Biff is watching them.) It's perfect Lorraine! Oh, look how good it is, it looks so good! (Terry drives off as Biff goes over to the girls.) Well lookie what we got here. Pretty nice dress, Lorraine. (He lifts up Lorraine's skirt.) Although, you'd look better wearing nothing at all.</p>
